Cognifide PowerShell Console for Sitecore
=======

PowerShell environment for Sitecore allowing to apply complex modifications, manipulate sites, files and items and perform content analysis & reports.

Have you ever found yourself:
- having to make a mundane change to a large number of pages?
- in need of getting statistics on page properties or page type usages?
- being curious of e.g. what’s the oldest page on your site?
- having to copy or move a large number of files from one folder to another or between versioning and non versioning virtual path providers?
- renaming or deleting files in your Media Library en-masse?

If the answer to any of those (and more) is a “yes!”, I believe you will find the module useful.

The idea behind the project is to create a scripting environment to work within Sitecore on a granular level to allow you to apply complex modifications and manipulate not just sites, but files and pages on a large scale or perform statistical analysis of your content using a familiar and well documented query language.

If you have any issues with the PowerShell Console module, please report them in the Issue Tracker . Feel free to report any bugs or improvement suggestions. We'll also gladly respond to any of your questions on Sitecore Shared Source Modules Forum or in the Project Discussion Pages.

Enjoy!
