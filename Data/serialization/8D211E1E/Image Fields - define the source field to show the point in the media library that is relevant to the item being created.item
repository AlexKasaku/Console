# What "Image" type fields do I have and in which template? Do they have Source defined?
#
# Sitecore recommendation:
#    Image Fields â€” Define the source field to show the point 
#                   in the media library that is relevant to the item being created.
#
# Before executing this script point the "Context Item" to where you store your solution templates e.g. "Sitecore/templates/My Site Templates"
#
# How to read this report?
# ------------------------
# The report will show all fields of type "Image" and a path ot a template it's defined in.
# Just because field does not define Source, doesn't mean it's a problem, but this report allows you to have a view on all of them and decide.
